# Java

There are multiple linting tools available for Java. Checkstyle, Lightrun and PMD are mentioned to be top three linters for Java in javatpoint.com. Checkstyle works natively with CLI and Ant. It has a plugin which works with many IDEs. Lightrun is a run-time debugger so itâ€™s not really a linter. It still helps to improve code quality. PMD work well with many different languages so it might be good option if one wants to use the same linter for both back- and front-end. [1.]

The most popular testing framework for Java is JUnit. With JUnit you can write unit tests for your code. The latest version of JUnit is JUnit 5. JUnit 5 requires Java 8 or higher on runtime. Another testing tool which can be used with Java is Selenium. Selenium tests websites functionality on browsers. Some other available testing tools for Java are TestNG, SerenityBDD and Mockito. [2;3.]

Jenkins is mentioned to be one of the best build tools for Java. Gradle is open-source build tool for Java. Apache Maven is open-source tool as well. There are other options available as well. [4.]

One option for CI in Java is Travis CI pipeline. It is a cloud-based service which tests and builds projects hosted on GitHub. Since Travis CI is a cloud-based service it would be better to run it in cloud-based environment rather than self-hosted. [5.]
